    <h3>College</h3>
    <p>When I get to college I would like to go into some type of medical program. If I go into a medical program I know that it would be hard to play a sport too, but I would like to go to college on a scholarship; especially if I end up going to medical school after. With that, I would like to get a full or almost full scholarship for either soccer, or softball. I think that soccer is ten times more fun than softball, but I know the game of softball more.</p>

<h2>Post College</h2>
<p>After college is over, I would like to go into some type of medical field, whether it is surgeon, nurse, pediatrician, or even athletic trainer. I love to help out society. One thing that made me want to go into the medical field was the show Greys Anatomy. That show is the best show ever and influenced me to try out medical field.</p>
