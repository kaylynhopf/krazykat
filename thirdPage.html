    <h3>Travel Soccer</h3>
    <p>I used to play travel soccer until I was about 13. I stopped playing club soccer because I had just gotten onto the Bandits which traveled almost every weekend. The fees for bandits were over the top too, and we couldn't afford to play two travel sports. I played for Westerville United from the time I was 8 unitl the time that I was 13. I might start playing club again soon because my new softball team's fees are about half of what the others were. We also won't travel as much on this team.</p>

<h2>High School Soccer</h2>
<p>I am playing Varsity high school soccer for the Licking Heights Hornets. I play mostly center midfield and center defense. I love playing soccer, im my opinion soccer is more fun than softball is, even though I know softball more. In high school soccer, it is way different than club. It's not the same intensity, and obviously the people are going to be different. In my first season of varsity soocer I lettered and I was also the first Freshman in Licking Heights Girls Soccer to be recognized in an all conference team. I got second team all conference and I also recieved my Teams MVP award this year.</p>

<aside class=""><div class="child aside"><h3>Colleges for Soccer</h3>
<p>I think that I am good enough to play soccer in college. I believe that since I work just as hard at soccer as I do in softball, that I would be just as good at college soccer than I would be at softball. For soccer I would be looking to go D2 or D1. If I play college soccer though, I would have to be in better shape. I am looking at colleges like Bowling Green State, Ohio State, Ashland, Indiana and Louisville. I will probably start going to some soccer camps soon. I have a recruiting profile for soccer on fieldlevel.com that has all of my information.</p>
