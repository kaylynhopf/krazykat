      <h3>My goals in Softball</h3>
      <p>In softball originally my goal was to play at a division 1 college for softball. I still would like to play in college. I play on a very competitive team that travels everywhere. I work for softball every day. I am so hard working, I think that I deserve to be able to play in college.</p>

<h3>Travels for Softball</h3>
<p> I just played for the Bandits, I have been all the way out to California, and I have been to Panama City, Chicago, Boulder, Dallas, Las Vegas, and many more. We traveled almost every week over the summer. With softball I have almost no free time to hang out with friends. I feel like it's always softball, and it will always be softball.</p>

  <p>As I said before, I really want to play softball at a division 1 college. I've been to several college camps. I've been to a camp at Ball State, Ohio State, Pitt, and Ole' Miss. I would really like to go to Notre Dame, or Ole' Miss. This year I plan on going to D1 camps too. I have a profile for recruiting on ncsasports.org that has all of my information.</p>
